* I do think the system should assume virtualization as standard.
  currently only the x86/64 family of processors and machines can be assumed to reliably support virtualization,
  ARM cannot unless on high end server hardware
  I believe that in the future powerful riscv64 processors with virtualization enabled will become common and assumed to be standard.
