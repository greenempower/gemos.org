        <h1>Draft / GenLin (Gen Linux) tool</h1>

        <p>This is the draft for a tool named Gen Linux. It's purpose is to prepare a customizable Linux image for hosting GEMx.</p>

        <p>This tool should be a much more compact and easy to use solution to Yocto. It should favor simple descriptions and interactive elements.</p>

        <p>TODO:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>handle kernel compilation and configuration and patching</li>
            <li>provide the lowest common denominator of packages and configuration</li>
            <li>package as img</li>
        </ul>
