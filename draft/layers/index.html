        <p>GEMOS will define some number of layers.</p>
        <p>The first layer will be one which sits between what is generally assumed to be a kernel (specifically Linux) and the rest of the system. It is defined so that GEMOS is not necessarily dependent on any particular third party kernel. And it is so that GEMOS isn't married to a traditional hardware configuration which cannot always be assumed.</p>
