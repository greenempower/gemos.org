--- GEM OS Roadmap (draft) ---
This is just aiming to be a list of broad milestones and potential versionings. GEM OS is a long term project with the goal of eventually becoming a big player in the systems space and to become integrated in other projects.


#:
- provide a working dev container which can generate deploy it's own dev vm (this can just be a very simple Linux installation)

#:
- complete very basic versions of the core modules (vm, registry, net, gfx)
- create a very simple add that uses those modules

#:
- provide a layer such as comms for more complex apps/services/modules to communicate with each other
- make basic implementations of more complex systems reguarding simulation, design algorithms, crypto and peer to peer communications

#:
- Create the first implementation of metalang. All code above the most basic modules should be written in metalang.

#:
- deploy a simple wiki at wiki.gemos.org
