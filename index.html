GEM OS
</p>

<p>This is the primary software system of <a href=http://greenempower.org>GEM</a></p>
<p>Currently it has a V layer which should run in a Linux countainer or special VM and the X layer which sits on that context and exposes several interfaces and a VM.</p>
<p>I have not yet made the source public but I'll draft on this site.</p>
