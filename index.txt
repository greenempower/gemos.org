--- GEMOS Project ---

GEMOS (Green Empower Operating System) is a project by GEM (greenempower.org).
It is a system and extensible application platform environment.

The first need for GEMOS comes as a system for packaging and distributing GEM applications and frameworks, using containers and VMs.

Eventually I would like to see GEMOS as a viable consumer OS (+hardware) which can somewhat offset the dominance of corporate products, particularly Microsoft Windows and Google's Android.
